        <h4>HTML</h4>
        <p><strong>Hypertext Markup Language</strong> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and <span style="color:blue">scripting languages</span>            such as JavaScriptAside from the different opening declarations for a document, the differences between an HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 document—in each of the corresponding DTDs—are largely syntactic. The underlying syntax of HTML allows many
            shortcuts that XHTML does not, such as elements with optional opening or closing tags, and even empty elements which must not have an end tag. By contrast, XHTML requires all elements to have an opening tag and a closing tag. XHTML, however,
            also introduces a new shortcut: an XHTML tag may be opened and closed within the same tag, by including a slash before the end of the tag like this: <br />. The introduction of this shorthand, which is not used in the SGML declaration for
            HTML 4.01, may confuse earlier software <del>unfamiliar</del> with this new convention. A fix for this is to include a space before closing the tag, as such:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Block elements</li>
            <li>Inline elements</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>CSS</h4>
        <p><strong>Cascading Style Sheets</strong> is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.
            <I><u>CSS is a cornerstone technology</u></I> of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.CSS information can be provided from various sources. These sources can be the web browser, the user and the author. The information from the author can be further classified into inline,
            media type, importance, selector specificity, <sub>rule order</sub>, inheritance and property definition. CSS style information can be in a separate document or it can be embedded into an HTML document. Multiple style sheets can be imported.
            Different styles can be applied depending on the output device being used; for example, the screen version can be quite different from the printed version, so that authors can tailor the presentation appropriately for each medium.

        <h4>Java Script</h4>
        <p><strong>JavaScript</strong> often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. <em><strong>JavaScript is high-level</strong></em>, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket
            syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.JavaScript also supports promises which is its way of handling asynchronous operations. There's a built-in Promise object that gives access to a lot of functionalities
            for handling promises and defines how they should be handled. It allows you to associate handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure reason. This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods:
            instead of immediately returning the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise to supply the value at some point in the future. Recently, combinator methods were introduced in the JavaScript specification which allows developers
            to combine multiple JavaScript promises and do operations on the basis of different scenarios. The methods introduced are: Promise.race, Promise.all, Promise.allSettled and Promise.any.</p>
